# Contributing

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's few guidelines that should help you as you prepare
your contribution.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

## Development

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo

3. Make sure you have the matchig version of `pnpm` installed by running `pnpm --version`. Currently, we're on `9.8.10`

4. Run `pnpm` to install dependencies.

5. Start playing with the code! You can do some simple experimentation in your own project or start implementing a feature right away.

### Commands

**`pnpm dev`**

- Watch-mode -> Build the package while you code

**`pnpm build`**

- deletes `dist` and re-compiles `src` to `dist`

**`pnpm test:unit`**

- runs all unit tests

### Tests

We use Vitest for testing. After implementing your contribution, write tests for it. Just create a new file under `src/` or add additional tests to the appropriate existing file.

Before submitting your PR, run `pnpm test:unit` to make sure there are no (unintended) breaking changes.

### Documentation

The documentation lives in the README.md (for now). Be sure to document any API changes you implement.

## License

By contributing your code to the GitHub repository, you agree to
license your contribution under the MIT license.
